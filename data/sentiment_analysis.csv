Yesterday Willf got accepted for a flat in Bristol and he said I should show him a good night out there. George had a really good birthday watching the cricket. Everything is looking up, I can’t believe how far we’ve come. It’s important to look after my mental health not just for me but also for my family and friends. I spoke to Dad yesterday and he thinks because my friendship group isn’t the same that’s why I’m struggling because Im so used to always having people round me. I think that’s very fair. I think I also need to feel ‘needed’ like I don’t have much purpose at the moment. But I’m back at uni in two weeks and I should be starting this new job next week hopefully.

"23 September,""Dear Anna, Today is Svenny’s 25th Birthday. Today is also Yaz’s housewarming party. I’m wearing big blue jeans, a white tee, pink knock off uggs and matching neck scarf and a pink cowboy hat. So I just got home, I haven’t been here for two days. I left for the doctors on Thursday and didn’t get back til lunch Saturday. First the doctors was okay, I got prescribed propranolol which should help with my panic attacks and anxiety symptoms. Then I went to see Jacob in Battersea park, we sat in the café which will always be our café in my eyes. We chatted for two hours and didn’t play any football. We spoke about mental health, mine mostly but his too. We also talked about trying to be better friends and how some of the things ge said to me affected my mental health and how some of my actions had confused him, which is fair. We spoke about family, friends and uni. I left to pick up my prescription then went east to have dinner with Camo. I ended up staying the night because we got stoned. But it was good really because it meant I could help get Camo out of the house. I tided his room and went with him to get his hair cut. We then went to Stratford (westfields) to sort out our outfits. At this point I felt a bit overwelmed and over stimulated. We then went to bethnal green, I had a non alcoholic drink then went to phoenixs and went to the pub where I had a guiness but its Friday. O took an anxiety pill because Jaocb was coming. Me, Camo and Jacob then went to smoke a joint and walked to Helina’s housewhich was fun but also a bit strange. The Phoenix went to bed and we had to decide what to do. The three of us went to Oxborough House. Jonny was there and waited to hang. On the waay the boys had an argument at the bus stop about Camo’s mental health, I don’t really like the way Jacob handled it but I think the message got across because Camo opened up to me this morning on the way home. I’m back now had a shower, Amy’s coming round 6ish to cut my hair. I need to eat some food and lok after myself before this party because I’m very nervous I might say something I don’t mean. What am I worried about is being drunk around Jacob because he’s definitely a trigger. I think he will be well behaved but we’ll see. I’m also worried that I will tell him I still love him. I’m happy to have my friend back truly that is all I want. But obviously there’s a lot of things I still love about him. If he shouts at me I will call him out. I hope he doesn’t but he gets a bit angry after a couple of drinks so we’ll see. I have a lot to be grateful for a look forward to.I trust myself to keep me safe. I have great friends around me truly. I love to dance and cant wait to make a fool of myself. I love you, forever + always, Anna P.s.

"24 September,""Dear Anna, I’m loving the affirmation app that Jonny put on my phone. I think its actually making me feel better. The party yesterday was fun but I dipped at 3ish. Jacob and Yaz tried to cheer me up but I think I was so tired and overstimulated. It was nice to stay at the boys house all together because it meant that I wasn’t alone when I felt anxious which I really did. I also left my meds at mine which didn’t help. I fell asleep in Jacobs clothes in his gazza top and shorts. I wore it to breakfast as well. I think I still love him, I know I do and I probably told everyone as well. It’s pretty obvious anyway. He makes me so happy but I don’t want a relationship with him, our friendship is so important to me. He is kind and compassionate as a friend but not a boyfriend. Don’t forget how he made you feel babe, you deserve someone who will travel oceans for you. After breakfast I went home then travelled east to see Tom. We did DMT togther, on a Sunday! It’s interesting Tom told me the colour you see is important. I saw green. Green auras mark a grounded, hard working person who is a nature lover. It was strange and felt weird but I felt a lot less anxious afterwards. I then had a drink with Paris and chatted a lot of shit. I then got the wrong overground home.

"27 September,""Hi love, I want you to know how proud I am of you. I am proud of me. Finally reaching out. Lets see how this treats you and how the anti depressants work. Over the last week I have been trying to look after myself better. I was very honest with Amy. I cried but I didn’t weep. Its okay to weep but I am on a journey of control. To regain myself. To love and cherish the one that I am, and to accept her with all her flaws. Til the age of 23 I have endured a lot and will encounter more no doubt, but as we move I embrace my true whole being as mine. I think this BS app Jonny showed me is working, Amy said she doesn’t think I have Bipolar and BPD isn’t screaming at her. She thinks the manic episodes come from repression of my depression. I don’t think I quite remembered that right. She thinks I might have pTSD, which would make sense but I don’t have the nightmares anymore but I am definitely depressed. I think that’s okay. Shes gonna call me on Tuesday to let me know. I’m gonna be at uni but that should be fine.

"3 October,""Dear Anna I’m struggling to journal today, I think I feel low today and that’s why. I’m going to start with the positives. I saw Tom and Amy yesterday, I’m so happy that were friends outside of work. Both of them are really important to me. Tom is so kind and protective and Amy is really compassionate and just understand me. I’m a little upset about how they were speaking about Paris, I’m going yo text her soon and go fro a drink. I feel like it might cause some drama but it sounds like she needs a friend. Uni is going really weel, I’m super engaged and I’m really excited I also got two A’s in my last project from 2nd Year. Which is great and Liverpool womens beat Arsenal on Sunday which is crazy! It would be silly to not admit that I feel low today because I’ve drank the last two nights and Friday I stayed at Camos too. But really I think I’m still sad about Jacob, its annoying because I don’t want it to be an issue. But my feelings are valid. It made me feel sad seeing Jacob talking to Sinead, not because either are in the wrong, if something happened with them, then II would be so angry. I know I’m not over Jacob yet and that’s fine. I want him to be happy, I think I’m scared he doesn’t have respect for me. I might talk to him about this. I’m going to try to understand why I feel like this because its been playing on my mind. To be fair its been really intrusive thoughts and that’s not what I want. Both me and Jacob have really been trying hard to be friends and I really apricate that. He also looked a little down at the party, I dunno if he was tired but it didn’t  look like it. I’ll remember to ask him on Friday. I think he struggles to see me and Tom be friends, it came up when we were together too. Looks like a lot of the reasons why I feel down could be resolved a bit if I spoke to Jacob about it. This is what I struggles with before because I miss having him around as a mate. I also really really miss Svenny at the moment, hopefully we can call soon.

"6 October,""Today is a new day. I woke up early this morning and went to play football with Jacob, he was waiting at Pear Tree for me, We walked around the pond and he kicked shit (literally) It was nice catching up with uni and he asked about my results. He seems interested in what I’m up to and I showed him ‘Strandbeest’. I hit the crossbar which I’ve been trying to do since we started playing football together and I even managed a few keepie uppies! We spent about 3 hours together and for once actually spoke about the break up and how it is being friends. I told him about Sinead and how it made me feel. He told me I should have just joined their conversation.Anna, I want you to remember what he said: ‘I will never try to hurt you’Even if he doesn’t stick to it he has told you, and when we have nothing we have our word. We argued a little but that is very normal for us. I think hes probably in the same place I am, just getting over the break up. He wants to give me my things back. Posters, yes. My orange painting, a plate my dad made + something else (…) He doesn’t want the painting to throw it away. He doesn’t want to bin it, but I said to put it in a box or in a bottle and throw it in the thames. I think he might do the latter. We spoke a lot about mental health etc and film club. I felt really good learning anf the sun was shining. I hope hes doing okay, he has his own mental health issues going on and he’ll talk about them when he’s ready. I still love him, but as a friend we spoke about dating other people and he told me he’s not ready to date yet but maybe for his gig hes going to. Once I got home I ate lunch and then my therapist called, she told me that she spoke to her supervisor and they want me to fill out a form to see if I have PTSD. She also wants me to go on the waiting list for CBT, which is 6 months long. Before that I’m going to partake in group therapy called ‘Overcoming Depression’ and can’t go to the in person sessions so its online at 10:30 on Fridays so I’m going to do 4 of them and check in again. I feel positive about it actually, it’s a long wait and I 6 months is the kind of deadline I gave myself to get better, but if it takes longer I am in no rush. I’m finally put my mental health first for me and it feels really good.n Lets see how it comes, I’m just taking each day one by one. Phoenix is gonna stay over tonight so I’m gonna clean my room.
