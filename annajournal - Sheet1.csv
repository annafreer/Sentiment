12 September,"Fresh book, fresh start. With this I’m going to try to stay more positive and enjoy the little things. If the only thing I do everyday is try then that’s all I can ask. I’m currently at home because being alone in London was doing me no good. So today I think me and Em are going to go to IKEA. Yesterday Willf got accepted for a flat in Bristol and he said I should show him a good night out there. George had a really good birthday watching the cricket. Everything is looking up, I can’t believe how far we’ve come. It’s important to look after my mental health not just for me but also for my family and friends. I spoke to Dad yesterday and he thinks because my friendship group isn’t the same that’s why I’m struggling because Im so used to always having people round me. I think that’s very fair. I think I also need to feel ‘needed’ like I don’t have much purpose at the moment. But I’m back at uni in two weeks and I should be starting this new job next week hopefully. I’m going to enjoy my time and home and get some fresh air. I’m also gonna try and keep up with this because it soothes my inner dialogue which is currently directed at me. Lots of love, Anna"
13 September,"I had a really good day yesterday, chats with mum and Em really sorted me out. Mum even apologised for overlooking my mental health as a child and for not knowing about him. She even acknowledged that she wasn’t emotionally available during our childhoods. I woke up today still feeling a bit down but I’m driving Em up to Liverpool today, so that should give me something to focus on. I had a dream that I met a new therapist but as I was trying to leave I kept losing things around his flat and couldn’t actually leave. The night before I dreamt about herding sheep with Jacob and PB."
14 September,"Today has not been so good but not totally lost. I went up May Hill and cried. Iwatched when Harry met Sally and cried. I found some old art stuff of mine and laughed. I made a small sketchbook before foundation as summer homework. A book to describe myself. Page 1 – Family Page 2 – Fear Page 3 – Love. In order of which I choose to describe myself, afraid is second. Yo Anna WTF. But true tho. Anyway I think I might walk the dogs again.Feel like it might help."
16 September,"Dear Anna, I want you to know how much I love you. I love the way you care for other people. I love the way you cry at every film. I love your laugh. I love the way you dance. I love the colour of your eyes …."
18 September,"The last two days have been very intense. On Saturday I cried so much I took an uber to Phoenix’s and stayed there all day. Then I stayed at Dairana’s. Yesterday was definitely better but I was fighting tears on the bus to and from Battersea. I messaged Jacob about it and he ignored my message. I guess that’s fine. At least I know now, I’m not really sure what I know but I don’t think I’ll try again to reach out to him. It must be hard for him to receive that message but if he wants to be friends then he needs the good and the bad. That is who I am. I’m trying to work out who I am again because I’m not sure. I think the people around me would be able to tell me. What I know for far: Vegetarian Bisexual Female Intelligent Anxious Footie fan Artist Female artist fan Fun Alcoholic Dancer Traveller Curly hair Reader Lactose intolerant I’m gonna keep working it out. I love you, Anna xx"
23 September,"Dear Anna, Today is Svenny’s 25th Birthday. Today is also Yaz’s housewarming party. I’m wearing big blue jeans, a white tee, pink knock off uggs and matching neck scarf and a pink cowboy hat. So I just got home, I haven’t been here for two days. I left for the doctors on Thursday and didn’t get back til lunch Saturday. First the doctors was okay, I got prescribed propranolol which should help with my panic attacks and anxiety symptoms. Then I went to see Jacob in Battersea park, we sat in the café which will always be our café in my eyes. We chatted for two hours and didn’t play any football. We spoke about mental health, mine mostly but his too. We also talked about trying to be better friends and how some of the things ge said to me affected my mental health and how some of my actions had confused him, which is fair. We spoke about family, friends and uni. I left to pick up my prescription then went east to have dinner with Camo. I ended up staying the night because we got stoned. But it was good really because it meant I could help get Camo out of the house. I tided his room and went with him to get his hair cut. We then went to Stratford (westfields) to sort out our outfits. At this point I felt a bit overwelmed and over stimulated. We then went to bethnal green, I had a non alcoholic drink then went to phoenixs and went to the pub where I had a guiness but its Friday. O took an anxiety pill because Jaocb was coming. Me, Camo and Jacob then went to smoke a joint and walked to Helina’s housewhich was fun but also a bit strange. The Phoenix went to bed and we had to decide what to do. The three of us went to Oxborough House. Jonny was there and waited to hang. On the waay the boys had an argument at the bus stop about Camo’s mental health, I don’t really like the way Jacob handled it but I think the message got across because Camo opened up to me this morning on the way home. I’m back now had a shower, Amy’s coming round 6ish to cut my hair. I need to eat some food and lok after myself before this party because I’m very nervous I might say something I don’t mean. What am I worried about is being drunk around Jacob because he’s definitely a trigger. I think he will be well behaved but we’ll see. I’m also worried that I will tell him I still love him. I’m happy to have my friend back truly that is all I want. But obviously there’s a lot of things I still love about him. If he shouts at me I will call him out. I hope he doesn’t but he gets a bit angry after a couple of drinks so we’ll see. I have a lot to be grateful for a look forward to.I trust myself to keep me safe. I have great friends around me truly. I love to dance and cant wait to make a fool of myself. I love you, forever + always, Anna P.s. I was a great big sister talking to Em about her night out and yesterday she went to see her friend which is a big step"
24 September,"Dear Anna, I’m loving the affirmation app that Jonny put on my phone. I think its actually making me feel better. The party yesterday was fun but I dipped at 3ish. Jacob and Yaz tried to cheer me up but I think I was so tired and overstimulated. It was nice to stay at the boys house all together because it meant that I wasn’t alone when I felt anxious which I really did. I also left my meds at mine which didn’t help. I fell asleep in Jacobs clothes in his gazza top and shorts. I wore it to breakfast as well. I think I still love him, I know I do and I probably told everyone as well. It’s pretty obvious anyway. He makes me so happy but I don’t want a relationship with him, our friendship is so important to me. He is kind and compassionate as a friend but not a boyfriend. Don’t forget how he made you feel babe, you deserve someone who will travel oceans for you. After breakfast I went home then travelled east to see Tom. We did DMT togther, on a Sunday! It’s interesting Tom told me the colour you see is important. I saw green. Green auras mark a grounded, hard working person who is a nature lover. It was strange and felt weird but I felt a lot less anxious afterwards. I then had a drink with Paris and chatted a lot of shit. I then got the wrong overground home. But I feel better now that the whole party is over. I’m happy me and Jacob can be friends. We planned a chat to the RA, Paris said it’s a date.Look after yourself, Hands + all Love Anna x"
25 September,"Dear Anna, Busy day, first day back at uni. Jass is moving in, Pheny + Dariana coming for the pub and Katie is coming to look at our spare room. I feel more positive today. Obongjayar’s tiny desk concert is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever heard.The Bell Jar is one of the best books I’ve ever read.Anyway, I love you, stay in dreamlandLove Anna x"
26 September,"Dear Anna Well done for organising the house and good roommates. Look after yourself I know you’re tired. Don’t forget about tomorrow’s doctor’s appointment. Have fun at uni today and think about that residency. Love you long time, Anna xx Anna, You fucking smashed it today! Good job speaking at uni, and you were excited about the pen drabber or whatever its called. Pen clotted? Pen plotter < Walked off the hyperness, good call. And great time watching bake off with the girls Love you Anna "
27 September,"Hi love, I want you to know how proud I am of you. I am proud of me. Finally reaching out. Lets see how this treats you and how the anti depressants work. Over the last week I have been trying to look after myself better. I was very honest with Amy. I cried but I didn’t weep. Its okay to weep but I am on a journey of control. To regain myself. To love and cherish the one that I am, and to accept her with all her flaws. Til the age of 23 I have endured a lot and will encounter more no doubt, but as we move I embrace my true whole being as mine. I think this BS app Jonny showed me is working, Amy said she doesn’t think I have Bipolar and BPD isn’t screaming at her. She thinks the manic episodes come from repression of my depression. I don’t think I quite remembered that right. She thinks I might have pTSD, which would make sense but I don’t have the nightmares anymore but I am definitely depressed. I think that’s okay. Shes gonna call me on Tuesday to let me know. I’m gonna be at uni but that should be fine. I’ve been listening to a Stephen fry interview and he as the wonderful human being seems has also been through a lot of mental health issues. Going to see Dariana later.Can’t wait. Love Anna xx How I am going to cut down my drinking Only drink twice a week Plan when I’m gonna leave (set an alarm) Use a drinking diary Eat Don’t pre drink Stick to singles What might help Having a nighttime routine Plan activities Don’t be scared to say no Focus on the other people there Stephen Fry – ‘Artists are special, arts is special, it does special things’"
29 September,"Dear Anna,Yesterday was a great day. I went to uni, we made inflatables. Jonny, Lily and I made an inflatable tube to help people in the room become better friends obvs the only people who were in the tube were us 3 and we’re all friends now. After that me and Jonny had dinner and the headed to the boys house. There I saw Jacob, Yaz, Camo, Phoenix and Dairana. Of course Nico too <3. I was very happy to be there and see everyone. I got a bit loud and angsty but not too bad. Jacob wound me up a nit and I wanted to get angry  but he wasn’t doing anuthing wrong. I think I am a bit sensitive because I want to spend more time with him but I feel good about where were at at the moment. I want to plan the weekend a bit so I don’t get too lonely or overwhelmed. Friday Charity shops Read Exercise Research Cook dinner Watch film Saturday Walk Gallery Art Get Camo a present Sunday Camo’s birthday"
30 September,"Dear Anna,You deserve endless love and happiness. Yesterday I went over to Camo’s we had falafel wraps for dinner with Phoenix. We smoked and watched TV. Pheny lay on kme as I stroked her hair. Iwas low and didn’t feel very present. This morning Camo + I cleaned because his family came round to celebrate his birthday. I called Jacob to try and arrange this spar day, he hasn’t got a clue how to put together a lego set let alone a party. I tried to not get to involved and Jacob tried to too. I wish sometimes we could speak for hours how we used to. I’m lucky to have those north acton memories. I am so grateful to be so welcomed into Camo’s family. I deserve endless love and happiness. Anna x"
1 October,"Cameron’s Birthday I’m super excited for today but anxious. I mean I have nothing to worry about because I’m surrounded by good people. Todau, I’m choosing to focus on the positives and remember to take deep breathes. I’m worried that Jacob might do something to hurt me, which is silly because he hasn’t yet and he won’t."

3 October,"Dear Anna I’m struggling to journal today, I think I feel low today and that’s why. I’m going to start with the positives. I saw Tom and Amy yesterday, I’m so happy that were friends outside of work. Both of them are really important to me. Tom is so kind and protective and Amy is really compassionate and just understand me. I’m a little upset about how they were speaking about Paris, I’m going yo text her soon and go fro a drink. I feel like it might cause some drama but it sounds like she needs a friend. Uni is going really weel, I’m super engaged and I’m really excited I also got two A’s in my last project from 2nd Year. Which is great and Liverpool womens beat Arsenal on Sunday which is crazy! It would be silly to not admit that I feel low today because I’ve drank the last two nights and Friday I stayed at Camos too. But really I think I’m still sad about Jacob, its annoying because I don’t want it to be an issue. But my feelings are valid. It made me feel sad seeing Jacob talking to Sinead, not because either are in the wrong, if something happened with them, then II would be so angry. I know I’m not over Jacob yet and that’s fine. I want him to be happy, I think I’m scared he doesn’t have respect for me. I might talk to him about this. I’m going to try to understand why I feel like this because its been playing on my mind. To be fair its been really intrusive thoughts and that’s not what I want. Both me and Jacob have really been trying hard to be friends and I really apricate that. He also looked a little down at the party, I dunno if he was tired but it didn’t  look like it. I’ll remember to ask him on Friday. I think he struggles to see me and Tom be friends, it came up when we were together too. Looks like a lot of the reasons why I feel down could be resolved a bit if I spoke to Jacob about it. This is what I struggles with before because I miss having him around as a mate. I also really really miss Svenny at the moment, hopefully we can call soon. I’m gonna fill out my calendar for this month and I think it will make me feel better. Growth is uncomfortable but I am strong enough  love you – Anna"
5 October,"Today is Mum’s Birthday, I think She’s 61. I missed yesterday’s journaling because when I woke up I still felt down but Welsh Daisy was in our house about the spare room, I saw her, spoke to Beth and went into Camberwell to do some uni work. I got all my results back, all A’s. I’m so proud of myself. I worked really hard last year, even with all my mental health problems. I’m not sure if it was worth all the tears but still, very proud. Maybe I’ll get a first. Even if I don’t, I have learnt so much and found new passions. Young Anna would be so surprised that I’ve been coding. And I love it. I want to code something for my phone which will help me when I feel anxious. I feel a lot better today, I think because I saw Camo yesterday, I went to his for film club and he chose a straight film, WTF. What else has been going on? I felt anxious speaking in class today but it was actually really good. But I think I should work on it more because I have really interesting theories and its one of the reasons, I’m doing the diploma. I’ll work on it, its only the second week I’m not going to be too harsh on myself actually. I still feel overly attached to everyone but I actually want a bit of a chill birthday so it doesn’t matter too much if theyre not all there. I’m seeing Jacob tomorrow. I don’t know if I’ll tell him how I felt at the start of the week, probably depends how anxious I feel. Anyway, I love you, keep it up gurlie,Anna <3"
6 October,"Today is a new day. I woke up early this morning and went to play football with Jacob, he was waiting at Pear Tree for me, We walked around the pond and he kicked shit (literally) It was nice catching up with uni and he asked about my results. He seems interested in what I’m up to and I showed him ‘Strandbeest’. I hit the crossbar which I’ve been trying to do since we started playing football together and I even managed a few keepie uppies! We spent about 3 hours together and for once actually spoke about the break up and how it is being friends. I told him about Sinead and how it made me feel. He told me I should have just joined their conversation.Anna, I want you to remember what he said: ‘I will never try to hurt you’Even if he doesn’t stick to it he has told you, and when we have nothing we have our word. We argued a little but that is very normal for us. I think hes probably in the same place I am, just getting over the break up. He wants to give me my things back. Posters, yes. My orange painting, a plate my dad made + something else (…) He doesn’t want the painting to throw it away. He doesn’t want to bin it, but I said to put it in a box or in a bottle and throw it in the thames. I think he might do the latter. We spoke a lot about mental health etc and film club. I felt really good learning anf the sun was shining. I hope hes doing okay, he has his own mental health issues going on and he’ll talk about them when he’s ready. I still love him, but as a friend we spoke about dating other people and he told me he’s not ready to date yet but maybe for his gig hes going to. Once I got home I ate lunch and then my therapist called, she told me that she spoke to her supervisor and they want me to fill out a form to see if I have PTSD. She also wants me to go on the waiting list for CBT, which is 6 months long. Before that I’m going to partake in group therapy called ‘Overcoming Depression’ and can’t go to the in person sessions so its online at 10:30 on Fridays so I’m going to do 4 of them and check in again. I feel positive about it actually, it’s a long wait and I 6 months is the kind of deadline I gave myself to get better, but if it takes longer I am in no rush. I’m finally put my mental health first for me and it feels really good.n Lets see how it comes, I’m just taking each day one by one. Phoenix is gonna stay over tonight so I’m gonna clean my room. Today went exactly how I expected, maybe even better. love you (and I mean it) Don’t forget what I told you today, Lots of love Anna x"
7 October,"Dear Anna I am a priority in my life. My health and healing matter. I went out drinking last night, it was kinda worthless, I dunno I had 3 pints andI was a bit drunk but I would have enjoyed it the same if I was sober. I need to take better action in sobriety but I’m gonna start after my birthday. Drinking turns me into a kinda nasty person, not so bad I’ll give myself credit but I want to exsude more positive energy and I don’t think drinking helps with that but it’s a week until I can take a break. I want to redirect my internal dialogue back to myself again. I matter.Anyway, I love you, Enjoy your day, Anna X"
8 October,"Dear Anna,I’m struggling to get out of bed today. Its not too too bad because I already ate. But I cried this morning thinking about what would happen if he showed up on my birthday. Which is silly because he probably doesn’t know its my birthday and definitely doesn’t know where I live. He won’t be there and if he is its gonna be okay, I won’t be alone and I am strong enough to handle any situation thrown at me. Tomorrow is gonna be a good day surrounded by people you love and that love you. I really liked one of my affirmations today ‘I am perfect for myself, I don’t need to be perfect for anyone else’ I really want to be happy with myself. I caught myself over the weekend being nasty about the way I look and being self conscious about it. But am I beautiful. I have lovely skin, gorgeous eyes, perfectly messy hair and cute lil cheeks. My body is perfect the way it is and strong. My body holds me and comforts me and moves me through every experience my body has been there, it is scared by the good and the bad but it is mine and it is perfect. That was so easy to write compared to the 16th September. I had a really good time with Paris lasy night but I feel a bit depressed today. I think its because of the drinks.I love you Anna,Lets talk later X "
11 October,"Dear Anna, I had such a good birthday, I’m now 24! 25 next year WTF.  My birthday did feel kind of strange. I think it’s because I’m not super close with my new housemates. The night before and morning of felt a bit sombre. But I went to uni, saw Jonny, then Yaz, Phoenix and Camo joined us + Lily. We went pub hopping. Dariana, Sinead and Jacob joined us. Then Parris, Amy + Tom after. We came back to mine, and they sang me happy birthday. I have lots of friends, they love me.I feel a bit numb about it. Anna"
13 October,"Dear Anna,I think I had abit of the birthday blues. Me + Camo stayed at Phoenixs last night, it does make me feel better waking up with someone else there but I don’t want it to become a necessity. Later on I’m going to nico’s leaving drinks but first I have a lot to do because I’m off to scouseland tomorrow. Friday to do"
14 October,"Dear Anna, I’m on my way to Liverpool, I’m excited to see her. Mom message to tell me her friend poppy isn't doing well at the moment. So we'll see what happens when I'm there. I saw Jacob yesterday and we had a brew and a chat before we went to nico's drinks. We were an hour and a half later and phoenix asked if we'd ******* which I thought was funny because it wasn't anything like that. We actually had a really nice time and talked about the break up a bit. He is a very important part of my life and I hope he knows that. Anyway enjoy Liverpool you deserve to have some fun I love you Anna"
15 October,"match day Dear Anna, how you feeling today? Confused? Yeah me too. Had a lovely time in Liverpool, i really needed that break from london. It was really nice to see my sister in such a better place. Friends are really nice, even if I think they take the **** out of eccentricities. Liz I can tell is a really good friend and Anna too. My sister really cares for me she said she told her therapist but i want she wants to fix mine and my mom's relationship which was really hard to hear because it's complicated and I think I want it fixed to. Strange how a year ago I wanted to cut all ties. I have really ground so much recently. I am committed to the path of self love and self happiness. I also really wish Jacob was around. I'm stuck in in a state of moving on and wanting to fall in love with him again. I can't work out if it's him or the idea of him. I wish i knew where his head is at about it all of this. I'm going to redirect this energy in full falling in love with my beautiful self. Something I realised recently is that I will have to forgive (him) at some point to move on. And i'm not sure how too. I don't think he deserves forgiveness but I deserve peace for love and happiness. I deserve. I love. You. Wholly,Anna"
17 October,"Dear Anna, I've got my fucked head in an absolute state about Jacob man. I don't know what to do so I was feeling pretty good like I'm getting over it was kind of defending myself and my decisions more. And then I guess we had a nice time at his the other day and he's sending me fucking Rachel Chinrioni tickets, back to texting about pointless shite. Bus he's got this gig coming up which he made a hinge for come to find a day and I heard the music and she's  fucking great. So I got all worked up like I wanna go but I don't wanna seem weird or like making moves. I just wanna go to the gig if he's not going with anyone else. I feel kinda in limbo and I don’t know if I'm Deeping it too much Income worried if I get too close I'm gonna fall for him again and get myself hurt. I also kind of worried about sending mixed signals. I need to think about what I want realistically I don't care about the gig I would be anxious anyway. I want Jacob to be in my life but with enough space that I can grow and focus on myself. He really helpful understand my issues but then also I can't help but have some feelings towards him.new line I trust in myself to learn from previous experiences and to do what's best for me. lots of love. Anna"
18 October,"Dear Anna, I'm feeling quite good today actually I might do some uni work. Me and yours went to play 30 and I actually got a good night's sleep. My life is pretty slow at the moment but it still feels quite a lot. I'm just kind of going with the motion but I feel a bit stranger and I want to focus on myself I just have to work out how. I want to throw myself into uni and my practise.Things I want to feel comfortable in: myself I deserve respect I deserve love I am smart I have a lot to offer the world my voice should be heard I have talent I'm a hard worker I am beautiful  I'm strong minded I own my own opinions I am worthy companion I'm a good friend I love myself I am loved by others I deserve only healthy relationships It's OK to need help I am my own individual I deserve someone who would cross oceans for me I deserve open communication I'm capable of many things I can handle any situation that comes my way Whatever is meant to stay will stay I am kind and I believe that I deserve good things Anna"
19 October,I want to remember my dream
20 October,"This really fucking works. I remembered my dreams. The first one was a bit crazy we were at my house(my parents) with lots of people from London, Paris, Jacob, Cameron and Jacob uni mates. I should above water and ask Jay to open it'cause it would spray everywhere and it went over me. I also had loads of wedding dresses. One point someones dog, which look like pip naomi's dog attacked are chickens and Emily saved it. The second dream we were all sat around a dinner table and I was looking at old photos and behind me Jay whispered but I looked beautiful and then I zoomed in on everyone RJ looked like Jeffrey Dahmer and Anastasia looked beautiful as ever. Then he told me to go upstairs to his room and I got on top of him like we used to And then he said what we gonna do and I woke up.I can't believe how vivid they were beautiful they really. I wonder if you can dream likely? I'm in a kind of limbo but it makes sense actually.I need to get ready for my cool but I'm going to journal later love you, dreams and allAnna  First talking therapy where am I and what is going on?Reflect on own needs strategiesmaslow's hierarchy of need self actualization esteem needs belonging and love needs safety physiological needs Stephen Covey circle the seven habits of highly effective people 1989 within my control within my sphere of influence out of my controlcan control: how I take care of myself how I approach work what I read what I buy what I give my attention to, time and energy to cannot control: football economy natural disaster weather whatever people think of me if we try to change the uncontrollable we spend less time on the controllable and can make us feel worse five areas model: situation, thoughts, emotions, behaviour, physical sensations put your own oxygen mask on before others stress bucket relaxation: activate rest and restore counterbalance stress heart rate and respiration rates walk music five things see, four things here, three things feel, two things smell, one taste.

21 October,"dear Anna,how are you sleepyhead? Today has been pretty sweet day actually. Last night me phoenix and Dariana went to the pub and run into yes housemates. We ended up in set where Dariana got too drunk and I bought her home. We spent the day doing hair and napping it was really relaxing actually. I had lots of thoughts about Jacob today but I'm gonna focus on myself and my happiness.I love you Anna"
22 October,I want to remember my dream I did not remember my dream and I slept for a really long time. Goals for today: go to charity shops buy  food cleaning supplies clean kitchen clean bathroom tidy room clean room cook dinner
23 October,"dear Anna, you didn't think I forgot about you did ya? Today I spent the day by myself and it was actually quite peaceful. I'm getting to a better place. The sad isn't so overwhelming. I'm really proud of myself. I'm ready to get back to work. I want to do more uni work and I feel more in control. I cleaned, cooked, 8, watched and looked after myself which may only be my physiological needs and safety but its stepping stones. love you Anna you deserve the world you're strong enough to handle anything that happens.Totally and wholly yoursAnnaI want to remember my dream, again I didn't remember my dream"
24 October,"Dear Anna, I’m  feeling really good today. Had a good time at uni, I feel rested, plans to see come later. I love you, enjoy this feeling you deserve it.Love, Anna, from head to toe."
25 October,"Dear Anna, It's time to find some motivation. We've slept late the last two days but you're in a good place to smash some work, make something, you are safe let's keep working on yourself. I might try to work  sheet out on what's on my mind. I don't really know how to use the work sheets but I guess well go to the exhibition and it will be fine I think I think he's trying to play some game but honestly I don't know I don't see him I only think this because of what Johnny said about the gig. I got a refocus on me again. Look after yourself today babe.Love you Anna Dear Anna, I know I can do better. Today wasn't the best mental health day. I stayed in my room when I could hear my house moves together which isn't like me. I think my meds are making me more tired. They definitely have lowered my sex drive. But the ups and downs I guess and more mellow by feel kind of numb today to be honest. I also haven't been replying to people or making that much effort to socialise but tomorrow I'm going to try better. My routine is more secure now so I might try stretch it and hello more exercise more schedule uni time. Baby steps. Love Anna"
27 October,"Dear Anna, Today has been a rough day I almost missed therapy and then I wasn't really engaged with it anyway then I showered and go back into bed till 3:00-ish. I ate some food. Then i went on a walk. It made me feel a lot better. Svenny told me she's glad that me and Jacob are friends because we have such a good friendship and it made me feel a lot better. I think I might do dry November.Lots of Love Anna"
30 October,"Good morning Anna, you've had a crazy weekend full of love and chatting shit or love for chatting shit. I also want to mention on Saturday you choose to look after yourself rather than please others and I'm so proud. This morning I woke up early because I wanted to wash my hair but instead I decided to check tonight or tomorrow but I meditated and cooked breaky. I feel ready to face a day whatever it throws at me.I love you, you're growing into the person we deserve to be. Who deserves love.Love Anna,XOXO Gossip Girl"
1 November,"Dear Jacob, this isn't meant for your eyes. To feel. With textured hands. I wish it was me. Waking up next to you. Hearing your ideas and thoughts. I really did love you, always did. I need to let you go the future is calling pastors gone and presents it has arrived. You would cringe reading this luckily it's for me and not for you. I was never truly open with you. I couldn't trust you, that was more your fault than mine. I am a soppy cunt. I love the idea of us but it's time to let go. I can't imagine you turning up with flowers anymore. That's all you had to do. £2.49 from Lidl. I'm sorry but I think I run out of excuses. Your friendship is important to me but not as important as my worthiness for love. I deserve to be cherished. You can see it. Thank you for everything but it's time I love myself I was yours hands and all. I wanted to give you the world I would have given you mine. love you, Anna Dear Anna,So I cried 11 times in October I'm quite proud of that actually. I stayed at Cameron's last night. It was me, Cameron, phoenix, Jacob and dariana. Dariana shouted at me to stop kidding myself about quitting smoking and I'm an addict. It made me feel really **** about myself. She also mentioned that Jacob had been on a day which in fairness I did already know about but made me feel really uncomfortable I don't care that jacob's dating but talking about it in front of me was uncalled for. I feel like it was unnecessary. Jacob will tell me if this morning he was to tell me about it's not her place. I'm happy to see that the way I'm dealing with it but it did make me feel awful yesterday. I'm acknowledging them and feeling them.I love you – forever. Anna x"
2 November,"I stayed in mile end the last two nights and had such a good time. I was upset yesterday about what doriana I said but then I went to see Tom, Paris and Amy with Cameron and phoenix and we had the best time. I haven't laughed so hard in ages. I came back home and went to the cinema with Lily and Sinead. We watched paul Mescal get vacuum packed in foe. Which I thought was really good love a good sci-fi me. I just realised that the Anna I write to is future Anna Because she reads this. Sometimes getting the pronouns and the tenses right is difficult. But here we are. You know I think my meds are working. I feel a lot better, still out of control sometimes but it's way more manageable. Camo called me donkey from Shrek earlier - make sense.I'm a bit anxious for tomorrow so I'm going to plan my day also tomorrow try the meditation and put way too much love and care into it "

5 November,"Dear Anna,I hope you're doing well. I've been doing a lot better. Struggling to concentrate today but it's Sunday. And proud of myself I stayed at phoenix's last night and said night two parties which is really good because I drank twice this week three times actually I had beers on Halloween. I also did coke once and smoked twice. I'm going to try re focus on sobriety this week. But today I went to borough market and walked home. I bought myself flowers on the way. I'm going to try and organise my week now so I know what to expect.I'm so proud of youlots of love Anna"
6 November,"Dear Anna,how much do you love yourself? Do you think there will be a day without self doubt? The future is looking bright. Each day I grow prouder. I take more action to better myself and look after myself. In two months i did not think i would be here saying no to spontaneous nights all so that I could stay in and have alone time. I hid my phone from myself who evening and I wasn’t even bothered. Have a busy schedule this week but I am very excited and I know I can manage it. I still haven't been to the gym or done that much uni work but it comes with time. I had an interview today and wasn't that nervous didn't need any propanolo. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning. I'm really proud of my progress. I don't know if I should tell Jacob we can't be friends anymore. The truth is I don't want to hurt his feelings but I'm going to hurt mine more in the long run. Everyone was so happy we could remain friends but I know it's gonna kill me seeing him with someone else. Hearing about him and anastasia's I have to be nice. I need to talk to him about this.Anna, I know you will do the right thing but make sure you do it for you.Love you a million times over,Anna"
7 November,"Dear Anna,I went to the doctors this morning and she gave me a bit of a reality check. About starting work again. Christmas and new year's and also about alcohol. I have been doing really well recently but i don't want to sink back. It's absolutely OK to have a down day but what harm would amount of really working on myself too? If I'm gonna do this I want to commit.Goals: exercise twice a week drink once a week meditate every day journal every day I haven't committed yet . I wanna sleep on it to make sure. Ilove you and You're so strong Anna Dear Anna,I think today could be the best day of my life... Grow up with me….Today I vowed to grow old with you. There's people I will love for eternity and you will be one of them. Three years and always supporting. Always checking in. You are in my thoughts and I am in yours. A friendship for life, I love I will appreciate when I'm old. I will continue to grow. I have faith, in life and love. I am under your spell. I will tell you one day but for the moment it's sweet in my heart. You deserve a love like this.Forever yours till then,Anna"
10 November,"Dear Anna, I fell a bit down today. I did yesterday it's. I missed therapy this morning. I did have fun last night but I'm not sure this is the way I want to live anymore. When I feel sad I'm scared it's gonna get bad again. I think I should talk to phoenix this weekend first up I miss Jacob. It's fucked. Think about the future look forward to it. You surrounded by beautiful  amazing people. Show I'm working on myself for you. I can give myself a break. I've been so good recently. I have to do what was best for me. You know exactly what you need.Lots of Love,Anna"
13 November,"Dear Anna, I thought about the line about the date. I'm embarrassed by how I've slipped recently. But today is a new day. In a new our. In a new minute. Every breath in a new second. I want to get some women's that will help me feel less tired. I think organisations is going to be key over the next couple of weeks. And abstaining from drinking I know I keep saying that but how far will it go? Let's start easy. Plan tomorrow.

You know I get so quiet after I've been drinking the next day is shit I also can't afford anymore.What to do instead: try all non alcoholic beers play cards drink juice practice breathing techniques"

Super excited to see the others tomorrow. Going to make a quick plan tomorrow and read till I fall asleep.Love you lotsAnna"
15 November,"Dear Anna,I’m super Distracted recently, unable to focus. I think I feel a little overwhelmed with how much I have to do. And where to start. But all I need to do is do. 1st I need to turn Netflix off I'm scared of the quiet. OK I'm going to meditate. I feel more present but not productive."
17 November,"Dear Anna,I've been a bit done this week in my alone moments. I've been super busy seeing everyone. I've had plans every night this week and socialised on all of them. But it has meant that I also haven't spent a lot of time working on myself. Tonight I'm going to have a self-care night and try to focus on why I'm feeling down. I've been meditating which is being helping me understand a little more what's going on. I'm going to try and keep that up. In therapy today they spoke about a warrior journal which I think in my try. So I write down why ovaries during the day and school them but then I let them go and only give myself 30 minutes to reflect on them in the evening. Which I think will be helpful to break that cycle. I really want to go to the gym but I can't find the motivation. Today I really need to do some uni work because otherwise I'm going to be really stressed and behind. So for future Anna I'm going to do it today.I love you a lot,Anna x"
18 November,"Dear Anna, You really need to hear this. Someone who makes you feel safe. Someone who has your best interests at heart. There is so much to love about you. You have been through things that they can't imagine. You will find someone who will want to understand. You deserve some kind. You're moving to a better place. I know it doesn't feel like this but you deserve the world. I won’t that you settle for anything less but you have to love yourself first. You'll find someone who would cross oceans for you. Someone who shows up when you need them to. No less. Be proud of how far you have already made it. At 23 you stopped a toxic relationship. You did that for younger you. She loves you for that. You understanding more about yourself an actively doing whats best for you. And I am eternally proud of that. Keep pushing and don't you dare give up. The life you wish for is right there to grab. Just go for it. You deserve it. You really do. You are the only one who doesn't see that. Get with the track. It's time to play. I <3 U XX"
20 November,What's happened to you? I know every day is up and down but you've been very happy today. I think dance music is to blame. Anyway well done for doing uni work
21 November,"Dear Anna, My attention span has been terrible recently. I went for run this morning but it did take up a good chunk of my morning. I have two hours till uni, so I'm going to tidy my room so it's nice when I get back on Wednesday. I'm also going to change my bedding and pack for Phoenix’s. I love you, keep taking your meds.Happy TuesdayLove Anna "
23 November,"Dear Anna, Life is getting busy again but I'm keeping my well-being at the forefront. Let's talk about the big thing first. I spoke to Jacob today. I had a red stripe at 3:00 PM I don't feel bad about it. I told him I need some space and he was fine about it but told me he wouldn't reach out and I would need to be very clear when I wanted contact again. I said I would. I gave him some advice about dealing with his feelings because he said he had really dealt with it too. I'm happy I told him everything I wanted to regarding us. He also told me some anecdotes and I returned the favour even though it felt a little unnecessary but we're still nice to see him. It still feels a little unfinished but I'm fine with how it went. I'm proud of myself. Everything I said I believed and came from me for me. That is a strange feeling to describe. We also saw so many people from my course which was quite nice as well. I feel like I was understood and I feel like this is what I needed. The truth is he isn't going to sweep in and save me. I am my own knight in shining armour. I don't want to let my trauma dictate my life anymore. How crucial is that. Really. I'm strong enough. I know I deserve to be loved I have the ability to sit down and diagnose my feelings. I'm whole . I'm present.I love you an unbelievably amount.This is for the best.Lots of Love,Anna XX"
27 November,"Dear Anna, Today I realised he stole so much of my identity, I'm scared to share myself with someone in case it happens again. It’s gut wrenching but realising the problem means I can accept it and develop into the person I want to be. Strange is seen as I realised I wanted to tell Jake but I don't need to, the love I have for myself is enough. And all I need to be is present.Dear Anna,I'm so proud of how far we have come. Let's not start slacking. Keep up the meditating shit and try to do this journal every day. Stay hydrated and eat well. Keep listening to love songs and watching ROM coms. You know one day you'll meet someone who you’ll never be able to live without.Til then I have you.Lots of Love,Anna "
29 November,"Dear Anna, I'm going to write later but before work I wanna say you are the person I aspire to be. Amazing, beautiful and kind. I love you. I love you for wanting to run a marathon (half) Do it for little Anna she would be astonished by our beautiful life.Lots of love Your favourite Anna Dear Anna, I have had an absolutely amazing day apart from the karens at work. I am now known as marshmallow queen which is just bonkers. I realised today how good I've been doing recently and I'm so proud of myself. I'm being kind to everyone I meet Even when it's hard and I've been practising patience. I've realised that I have beautiful people around me and I live in a wonderful city. I'm going to keep focusing on my mental health and take steps every day to better myself. Also my creativity is coming back and I'm so happy. I love you more than words can describe - Anna"
30 November,"Dear Anna, I'm so tired today and it's cold outside but I’m persevering. I’m happy about my group at uni I think it's going to be fun. I'm worried I don't have enough time but I will find time. I need to order some motors tomorrow.  In theory it shouldn't take too long and I cnat wait to see it alive. Jonny’s reaction was very funny but I don't think he understands the point in pointless. I just need to sort through my data set and read through the extra information for interface. Anyway I'm off to work I can handle anything that happens today,Love you, Anna"
1 December,"Dear Anna, I plan to go through in today but I overslept which I thought was gonna happen anyway. And I thought I called coming on so instead I'm going to do some yoga and drink some warm drink today instead. I have taken on a lot recently and I'm not sure my mind and body are ready for it yet. So today I'm going to be kind to myself and I'm going to get on with some uni work and look after myself today. Anyway check back in later.Lots of love Anna (OMG I dream jacob's parents died in Ross. It was awful)How could I possibly explain?The feeling of terror in place of love.Imploding and exploding.The vulnerability is too painful,what's worse is I wanted to.Every ounce of me wanted to.I can't even let go.I was scared of you.Felt like a child.How do I differentiate between fear and devotion.When I was told they were the sameI saw his face in yours.I will not apologise.You couldn’t handle me I can, and more,I love every part of myself that was too much, for you."
4 December,"Dear Anna, I let myself slip this weekend. Add a really good time but it's actually not really what I want at the moment. I don't want to be waking up tired on Monday because of the weekend. I won't be running in the mornings. I want to be ready for uni on Monday morning. Want to feel clean. I'm tired of waking up hungry. This week I will eat 3 meals a day. No excuses this week we're gonna smash it. I'm going to look after myself and focus see how I feel next Monday.Love you, Anna x"
5 December,"Dear Anna, Feeling a bit better today, still a bit down. I went for a run this morning which felt good but it was hard work. I feel rushed in a bit stressed. I'm gonna go to uni now and then head to Jonny’s after. I’m trying to look after myself. Lots of love Anna"
6 December,"Dear Anna, I had a great time at our Christmas party. Everyone's presents were so good. I got really annoyed at Jacob but Camo let let me talk to him about it which was really nice actually. The food was fantastic. We played a fun game as well. I feel a bit out of sorts today. I didn't really want to drink last night but I did anyway. Jacob was sick everywhere including on my bag. I feel totally unproductive today but I have work later and that will cheer me up. I had a good time at uni yesterday I really like my project even if it isn't exactly what they want. I just need to make sure I work on the other ones too.Keep trying to look after yourself. I know its hard.Lots of love, Anna Dear Anna, You have a place in this world, I know it's silly but you really did make a lot of people's night tonight. Earning 40 of  tips in six hours this mad. 5 really. Not that we are basing our self worth in over peoples opinions of us but you're very loveable kind and good hearted. Think about this when it's hard to get out of bed in the morning. A day as Anna Freer is a day worth spending. Keep chatting shit and making friends because their lives are better with you in it. I love you so so much. Keep fighting, take your meds, sleep well and tidy your fucking room.Youre killing it Lots of Love Anna"
7 December,"Dear Anna,I'm starting to enjoy my alone moments. I feel like socialising gives me energy and being alone soothes me. Keep saying: I belong here, my voice and opinion is important, I am clever and smart, I bring something unique to the table. I'm off to work soon and I'm absolutely shattered I'm glad I found some time for myself between uni and work. Lots of love Anna"
11 December,"Dear Anna,I've had a crazy weekend. On Friday I went to camos drag show I had so much fun and then Saturday I went to see the Liverpool palace game and I saw Trent. Then after I went straight to work and after that I went to Tropix in Clapham and drank Wray and Nephew till 2:00 AM. Sunday was my favourite. I went to see Paris and Amy, Tom was there and Ben. Emily join us we drank red wine and chatted shit. Then Zeus turned up And I have not laughed so hard in ages. We're planning a trip to Amsterdam, for a Jungle Boat Party! I'm so excited I want to keep sent it and focus on my mental health because this week is going to be a tough one. I love you always. Actually have a lot say still and I realise this entry is on the wrong page. Paris told me that she thinks me and Bailey will get married which seems bizarre but I want to look after myself and not live in a fairy tale. I want to be in love again. I miss the feeling path to be patient I guess and focus on what I want and believe. I need to grow. Early I really do want to be the best version of myself and that starts with self acceptation and self compassion. Turn all of myself and be proud to keep being who you are. the pieces will fall into place.Lots of Love Anna"
12 December,"Dear Anna, I had a line in today which was so needed. I didn't go for my run this morning but I will go at some point this week. I'm starting to get annoyed at Jass and Daniel for being so loud at night. I need to talk to Jass about it but he's always there.I’ll  Find time soon.I need to write a to do list today : washing food shop Christmas shopping Deep journal Emails Crochet Shower Tidy  Clean Dear Anna, I’ve lost touch with myself recently. Think I've been so busy and obviously the drink doesn't help. Had a great time over the weekend really the best in a while by Mori that is because I want to feel needed I like that people like having me around but I hate when they say every story I tell is about being drunk. I caught myself earlier being mean to myself about being so poor. I had to pay rent with my overdraft and it feels like maybe I won't be financially positive after winter Wonderland. When I get my loan in I need to portion it for my rent. I didn't do it in September because of my mental health but I'm in a better place now. I get tired really easily now. But I still do a lot. I want better energy levels I guess. I just wanted to everything but I also don't have the motivation. 3 hours a day is not too bad on my phone. I want to feel more confident. Not just in social moments. I feel as if I know how to act confidently. I am source of energy that glows, vibrant as a spring morning. I am warm and kind. Sweet, innocence. I'm lovable deserve true love.  One who travels oceans for me and I, them. I want some to solely have good intentions that is the love I deserve. I want someone to love me the way I'm learning to love myself. In spite of my imperfections, I really do love you Anna."
14 December,"Dear Anna, I woke up at 2am today And  set so many alarms. I wanted to go for a run this morning but now I don't have time. I don't understand why my body needed to sleep that much maybe because I didn't have much planned for today. I'm going to realign and go charity shop shopping try to get some fresh air maybe I'll go for a walk in the park. I'm seeing Yaz tonight so I don't have loads of time to mill about but I'm going to make time for myself it's hard to not get annoyed at myself when stuff like this happens but it's OK really not the end of the world I just want to feel better for later on.Lots of LoveAnna"
20 December,"Dear Anna, I decided to be naughty Anna for the next 10 days and in the new year I'll be good. I need to get something off my chest. I really fancy this guy from work. I can already feel that I'm going to look back at this and laugh. His energy infectious. He makes me laugh, keeps me on my toes. I just think he’s fit as fuck. I'm might ask him on a date. I wanna play mini golf.  It's so intrusive. I like him, I like the negging, I wanna know more. Anyway moving on, I slept with Fi again last night. It was good but I don't think I have feelings for her which is a shame I can't change that. My mind's been running a mile a minute recently. I think I need to make more time to process and reflect how I'm actually feeling. I do feel a big change coming soon and I need to be steering it. I love myself, always, flaws and allLove Anna"
27 December,"Dear Anna, Life has been really busy lately I need to make sure self-care and reflection is more integrated in my daily life , at the moment it feels like the first thing I forget. I also keep forgetting to take my meds. I think a more grounded routine in the new year will help with that. I'm really proud of myself and the way I've handled December. I haven't been perfect but I could have let December break me but I didn't. December help me move on from Jacob, make new friends and realise how important Phoenix and Camo are in my life. It also shown me how fragile I am. I don't mean that in a bad way I'm just reflecting but every night I went on I got with someone different and I think this is because I feel the need for love. I need to keep loving myself and practise being comfortable alone. All that I had fun and I don't regret anyone I got with, I need to be more safe about it. It’s definitely time for an STI text. I had a nice time at Christmas with my family. It was very quiet, Em + George’s mental health aren't so good at the moment and I definitely let it over shadow mine as per. I really need to tell mum and dad I want private therapy I don't know why it's so hard to ask for help. I need to do my year in review, I think it's going to be difficult to face 2023.First I’m gonna write 24 Goals for 2024 1. Learn to juggle 2. Run Hackney Half 3. Make Clothing 4. Work a festival 5.

28 December,"Dear Anna, I realised how much work I really need to do to get my mental health in a better place, I can feel the shift already but I think I'm gonna have to distance myself. Need to be able to say no. No, I wanna stay in. No, I can't get drunk. No I'm not smoking at the moment. I want to be consistent make a routine for myself I want to learn to be compassionate. Talk to myself as a best friend. For my inner dialogue to know who she is and what she wants. I want to imagine a future and to work towards that. Together me and you.Love always,Anna xx"
29 December,"Dear Anna, I can't believe it's nearly New Year's already. I need to look after myself in the run up, I woke up feeling 50%, half depressed, half fighting. So I'm going to fight to make my life easier."
31 December,I love that Sunday is the last day of the year. No regrets and all but fuck 2023. I needed you but that doesn't mean I enjoyed you. There was some great times. I found true friends. I fell in love. I realised my past loams over me like a creepy man on the tube and I need to call him out. I'm already quite overwhelmed but I'm taking time to sort myself out.
2 January,"Dear Anna, I'm writing this with Jonah’s Mums pen turns out she works from the corner from mine.  I still fancy him so much, The timing is all wrong though I know that. The last couple days have been absolutely mental. NYE was way better than I expected, because of my new mates. We just chatted absolute bollocks. I worked today too and I’m fucking exhausted. I’m resting tomorrow and doing good mental health exercises. I might go for a walk and organise myself better. I'm happy to start dry January today. FUCK 2023. 2024 – the year I look after me.Happy new year sunshine love you and your crazy, endlesslyAnna "
4 January,"Dear Anna, I'm really enjoying my alone time at the moment. I feel a bit bad for my mates but I feel like I'm healing. I'm really happy that I've made this much progress that I can sit and reflect on that. Cal’s waiting on a shag – on the phone to me. Nervous – hilarious. The lives of gay men, really took the Internet by story. I didn't have loads to talk about I went to uni today plan some stuff. Gonna have to work through the weekend but that's fine I don't really have plans anyway.Look after yourselfLots of love,Your Favourite Anna"
5 January,"Dear Anna, I've been meditating recently it keeps bringing me almost to tears… almost. I see beautiful glimmers. The colour so vibrant. I'm gonna keep practising. I like this soberness of January, knowing I won't wake up hungover. I'm reading the body keeps the score. Struggling to concentrate but unearthing another part of myself with every sentence. I know the process is slow but I'm proud of myself but I want to smoke so badly. If I start I won't stop. But I want it. The feeling will pass, slowly but surely. I love you, madly,Anna Declaration to myself: I will listen to myself and my needs and accommodate to them I will practise deep breathing I will sit with feelings even when uncomfortable. Accept and move on I will read the body keeps the score I will make time for myself I'll be proud of myself I would love myself, madly."
6 January,"Dear Anna, if you need a film to watch to remind you of recovery and its truth - watch good grief. I feel the poetry returning. We art and love of life. Understanding my trauma comes in waves, breezes and breaths. Acknowledging the ones I love, loved and will love. The people who have, will and do you love me. I'm a maker, a doer, a drawer, a painter and being. I'm present and understanding. I take each breath as it comes. Deeper than the one prior. For you on your journey, wherever it takes us. I will be there,always, Anna to deny sorrow is to deny love"
7 January,"Dear Anna, I'm a bit annoyed today because I was really excited to see Camo but Jacob is there and I can't really be fucked to deal with it. He has a strange energy at the moment and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I just don't know where the boundaries stand. I also hate the feeling of walking on egg shells. I think I just wanted time to catch up with Camo feeling safe and like I can talk about anything. I'm still going just a bit later. I might drop my stuff off and going to see Amy. Anyway I'm proud I could see and understand those feelings.Lots of love,Anna"
8 January,"Dear Anna,my dearest Anna, my head's a mess. It's been spinning around. I forgot to take my antidepressants again. I was productive today. Went to uni with Amy. But I don't feel very settled. I probably just need to meditate. I just feel a bit fuzzy. Tomorrow will be busy too. I want to go for a run but I feel tired and unfit. Although I know run will help with that. I'll be impressed if I manage it. I've been talking to other men I'm in love with in my head. Knowing how hard it is to fall in love, I wish I could focus on other things. I want to be alone but also I love to distract myself by people. To feel needed. But why is it so hard to feel loved? I had a lovely time with Camo last night he's a true friend. I love him for who he is, unapologetic. He's one of my favourite people to be around. Feels like a fight to work on my mental health. Like all the doors are locked, but I'm trying, god damn it. I’m fucking trying, It is tiring but I will keep at it. I love the world I live in too much not too. It's too much to lose it's a strange feeling almost like suffocating. I'm glad I'm getting this out. I feel the weights lifting off. It's hard to know what I need, to rest or to push. Feel so stuck in my own head. I want a therapist like Amy's, he seems so nice. I'm tired but I might meditate now. I won't feel rested when I wake up tomorrow. It's a new day and all that shite. Anyway future Anna,I love you, you’re who we are doing it for – present Anna."
9 January,"Dear Anna,There's a lot flying around in my head today but I'm being productive even if it's not quite going right. I told phoenix that she can't stay around tonight so I can look after my mental health and she took it well. She also asked me to be good around Sydney this week. I'll be on my best behaviour. Feel a bit rushed and not resold but all things considered is quite calm. I'm going to uni now. The pub quiz later. I feel super stressed about money but it's really OK we have time.Love you lots,also your hair looks amazing today. Love, Anna"
10 January,"Dear Anna, Proud of you for telling Johnny. Feel like I'm hiding away from the conversations on my phone but I'm really busy with uni stuff and to be honest I'm not really in the mood to be social. I'm even feeling like saying phoenix might be too much. But I've been super productive today and I deserve a nice night at the pub. I'm tired today but I think it's the weather as well. Tomorrow is the creative stuff which is stressing me out. I'm not going to do anymore uni stuff now. Gonna meditate, eat, pub, bed.Love u lotsSuper proud So clever Lots of love Anna"
11 January,"Dear Anna,So proud of you today, you absolutely smashed it. Keep up tomorrow. I'm shattered but I'm gonna go to bed early. You've been great today lots of work for deadlines but I'm impressed with how good you are. Just remember to look after yourself and stay present. Also thought about the future, maybe I could work in robotics. I like it and it pays well. Also I think I could walk into a job straight after uni and could travel with it too.Anyway sleep well, talk tomorrow, lots of love, Anna"
12 January,"Dear Anna, What is it quiet today? Too much time in your room? It's OK you're a good girl. Don't be scared. Put some raves today. So about supriya T.

13 January,"Dear Anna,I finished my leg warmers today. I have kind of got off the bandwagon with any work. I think I need to recentre and refocus so I'm going to go on a walk maybe buy new journal and buy something nice for dinner. Then I'm gonna come home and focus on any work. Gonna sit in the living room because my back hurts from sitting in my bed or on the floor. Anyway love you lots, Stay on the straight and narrow kiddo.Love ya,Anna"
14 January,"Dear Anna Sorry I'm 49 minutes late. It wasn't that I was so busy today I just thought I had done this. Today I went for a run, cleaned the downstairs, did future and also I went to see Paris and Amy. They came south for me. We booked Amsterdam, I'm so excited. Just a little too poor for it. I have savings but I need to get a new job soon. Anyway… I love you so much, endlessly. His to breaking the chain and looking after our assets.Stay strong kiddo,sweet dreams,Anna"
15 January,"Dear Anna,I'm only 37 minutes late tonight. So busy at the moment with uni. I'm trying to keep it together, no I am. I do feel overwhelmed today but my self-confidence has improved massively recently and I got angry today in my lectures which was fair and I realised it was the first time in ages I went mad in the moment, an appropriate amount. I feel like meditating is working I'm signing out a lot less, even if it means I feel like I need to spend more time by myself. One final push at uni, is gonna be worth it, I promise. I love you so much. You're smart, ambitious, funny, outgoing, compassionate and becoming more and more yourself. I'm abundantly proud of you.Love, Anna"
16 January,"Dear Anna, I still haven't cried yet this year, I might watch a sad film to get it over with. I've been on the verge during my meditations. Lily thinks it's a good thing. When I meditate today I pinpointed a pain in my back/shoulders when I was saying ‘may I be safe’. It feels a lot better now actually. I'm off to uni now. Feel good. I'm present. I am loved. I am Anna.Lots of love,Anna"
17 January,"Dear Anna,Anna, Anna, Anna. To be fair this was always going to happen at some point. I need to be more careful, but that's OK, the antibiotics will come tomorrow. I do need to contact the others I will. I'm scared, but it's the right thing to do. I think it's strange how it's only rectal Because the only person I did anal with was Jacob. I'm gonna have to tell him in person. Fuck. I know I only want to shag people I have the connection to but I don't know why sometimes a night out doesn't feel complete without bringing someone home. It's nothing to be ashamed of I really want to drink the full stop a shot of vodka or something. Want to cry but not about this. Is it disassociating to watch that's sad Lewis Capaldi video so I can cry? It's all going to be OK.I love you, no matter what.Anna 17 January So I broke dry January if I had one glass of wine and I can already feel the depressing elements. I'm looking at old photos. I realised I'm not that person and what a hold the drink and the drugs had on me. I think I like my sober little life. What is the meaning of being present? I disassociated a lot today, which is fair. Today has been quite a lot but I also feel quite present. My mental health is in such a bad place. Before talking to Lily and Sinead You say scattering and today I really leaned on them. I sat in the kitchen alone, it's the little things really.Anna, you got this.I love you endlessly, madly and totally – yours, Anna"
19 January,"Dear Anna, Yesterday what is the hottest day in awhile and the first in 18 days I had not written to you.  I was so sad, very sad. I spoke to a woman on the phone. She asked me if I was in danger because I ticked the domestic violence box. It was an honest mistake, a slip, it does feel like I'm still in that situation sometimes. I have that battle in my mind. But I'm fighting. Fighting -b command, manoeuvre in battle. In Korean contacts used to express encouragement incitement or support. I fight for the currently, past me, for the girls, the gays ,my friends, family and of course you. I'm realising the fight is over. It ended in 2018. My mind my body still think I'm there, it's the PTSD. I'm learning that the present is here, now. In London, in age, in wisdom. What should me was talking about the threesome in September. The rape. The third time. I couldn’t escape. But I will not let that happen again. Survivor- a person who copes well with difficulties in their life. I am proud, I have overcome every difficulty in my life. With age I'm getting better. I'm not perfect but I'm a survivor. I will keep fighting, it's what I know, it's how I'm trained, I'm strong. We are in control. We are safe. We are learning. I can lose a year of ‘20’s’ I have last years to fit in in that box. I'm about to break free. The revolutions are always hard to digest. Forever yours anna."
21 January,"Dear Anna, I was sick yesterday when I was meant to be doing any work. I let myself go to bed early and ordered takeaway because I was too sick to go to the shops. I look up this morning at 4:00 AM and felt the most awake I felt in a long time. I got up and did some uni work and I thought with my laundry. My laptop then started messing up so I took a break since then I have done 3 meditations and a 20 minute morning yoga. I feel good I can't wait for these deadlines to be over.Lots of love,the crazy one,Anna"
23 January,"Dear Anna, I got wasted last night with the winter Wonderland crew and had a great time but I don't feel good about my relationship with alcohol. And need to be confidently sober. I think I need to talk to a professional though. I’m exhausted and I feel so sick and to be honest I didn't really enjoy clubbing. But that's 'cause it was heaven. I'm gonna try and get an early night tonight and get up early tomorrow.Lots of love,Anna"
27 January,"Dear Anna, I feel a lot better now come on I just need to remember to live life the way I want to. I'm 7 out of 10 now just leaving the house come I doing any work come by talking to my housemates and eating well. It's 7:00 PM on a Saturday and I feel like arisa is sorting me out. I'm gonna push through and do more uni work tomorrow. I'm so happy with my job tattoo as well. Life is looking up, you don't have to prove anything to anyone. They haven't lived your life come out you process and learn from experiences and that's life.Keep your head up, Love ya, Anna"
28 January,"Dear Anna, Feeling pretty good, racing thoughts but manageable. I had breaky with Lily and Sinead was lovely. I want to plan out my week.A friend like Max.You were my Max, the type of boy who messages happy birthday at 6:00 AM, the type of boy he drunk texts but reacts at 2:43 and messages the next day. The type who writes: your waist is photosynthesizing but deliberately typos to cover the confusion.The boy you run from till the time is right, the boy who crosses oceans to find you have a boyfriend, the boy I would wait an eternity for. Just in case the time is right."
